### Patient Journey Analysis with Neo4j, the Graph Data Science Library, and Bloom

This repo contains the sample code from the Graphs in Life Sciences presentation and demo, from Neo4j's [Connections: Graphs in Life Sciences & Healthcare](https://neo4j.com/connections/life-sciences-healthcare/) event. This contains sample data, the queries and algorithm calls run during the demo, and the Bloom perspective used.

To load the data, please use the code from our Solution Team's [Patient Journey Model Repo](https://github.com/Neo4jSolutions/patient-journey-model). I've provided the data files I used, but you can generate data directly from Synthea to match your needs, and use the scripts in that repo to load them into Neo4j.
